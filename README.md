## Raspberrypi Datalogger and Screen System

This is the total code for the datalogger and the screen system for the car.
This program takes input from all the sensors, and then passes that to the 
screen and the data logger.

So far this is only a loose collection of example scripts and the screen, yet to be fully implemented.
This project is written in python the and the library used to make the screen is GTK
